1. The startup file for the GGWR is 'start.m'.
2. To organize your data in a style similar to 'demoData.xlsx'
	(In the demoData.xlsx file, the column 'beta_***' represents the actual 
	coefficients and does not require preparation.)
3. The 'ReadData.m' function in GGWR provides a method for standardizing
	independent variables, allowing users to decide according to their own needs.
4. After preparing the data and configuring the paths, enter 'start' in the 
	MATLAB command window to launch the program.
